"""
In problems where we deal with sorted arrays (or LinkedLists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain
constraints, the Two Pointers approach becomes quite useful. The set of elements could be a pair, a triplet or even a
sub-array.

Problem Statement : Given an array of sorted numbers, remove all duplicates from it. You should not use any extra space;
                    after removing the duplicates in-place return the length of the sub-array that has no duplicate in
                    it.

Algo :


Example 1:
    Input: [2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 9, 9]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The first four elements after removing the duplicates will be [2, 3, 6, 9].

Example 2:
    Input: [2, 2, 2, 11]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The first two elements after removing the duplicates will be [2, 11].
