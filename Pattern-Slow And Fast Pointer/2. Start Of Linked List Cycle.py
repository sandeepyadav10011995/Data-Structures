"""
The Fast & Slow pointer approach, also known as the Hare & Tortoise algorithm, is a pointer algorithm that uses two
pointers which move through the array (or sequence/LinkedList) at different speeds. This approach is quite useful when
dealing with cyclic LinkedLists or arrays.

By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic LinkedList), the algorithm proves that the two pointers are bound to
meet. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop.

One of the famous problems solved using this technique was Finding a cycle in a LinkedList. Letâ€™s jump onto this problem
to understand the Fast & Slow pattern.

Question: Given the head of a Singly LinkedList that contains a cycle, write a function to find the starting node of the
          cycle?
