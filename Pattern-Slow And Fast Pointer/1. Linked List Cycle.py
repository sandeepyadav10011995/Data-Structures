"""
The Fast & Slow pointer approach, also known as the Hare & Tortoise algorithm, is a pointer algorithm that uses two
pointers which move through the array (or sequence/LinkedList) at different speeds. This approach is quite useful when
dealing with cyclic LinkedLists or arrays.

By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic LinkedList), the algorithm proves that the two pointers are bound to
meet. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop.

One of the famous problems solved using this technique was Finding a cycle in a LinkedList. Letâ€™s jump onto this problem
to understand the Fast & Slow pattern.

Question: Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a function to determine if the LinkedList has a cycle in it or
          not?

Problem 1: Given the head of a LinkedList with a cycle, find the length of the cycle.
Solution: We can use the above solution to find the cycle in the LinkedList. Once the fast and slow pointers meet, we 
          can save the slow pointer and iterate the whole cycle with another pointer until we see the slow pointer again 
          to find the length of the cycle.
