    Merge Intervals -: This deals with overlapping intervals !
    In a lot of problems either we need to find overlapping intervals or merge intervals if they
    overlap.

    Case 1: A and B do not overlap.
    Case 2: A and B overlap, B ends after A.
    Case 3: A completely overlaps B.

    Case 4: A and B overlaps, A ends after B.
    Case 5: B completely overlaps A.
    Case 6: B and A do not overlaps.
