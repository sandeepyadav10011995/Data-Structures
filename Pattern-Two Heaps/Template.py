"""
In many problems, where we are given a set of elements such that we can divide them into two parts. We are interested
in knowing the smallest element in one part and the biggest element in the other part. The Two Heaps pattern is an
efficient approach to solve such problems.As the name suggests, this pattern uses two Heaps;
    Min Heap ---> smallest element
    Max Heap ---> biggest element
