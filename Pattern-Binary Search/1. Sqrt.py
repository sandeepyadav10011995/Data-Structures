------------------------------------------------------ Binary Search ---------------------------------------------------
1. It is quite easy to understand conceptually.
2. It splits the search space into half the size at every step, until we find the target. Therefore reduces Search Time
   O(N) --> O(logN)

But when it comes to implementation, it's rather difficult to write a bug-free code in just a few minutes. Some of the
most common problems include:
    a. When to exit the loop? Should we use left < right or left <= right as the while loop condition?
    b. How to initialize the boundary variable left and right?
    c. How to update the boundary? How to choose the appropriate combination from left = mid, left = mid + 1 and
       right = mid, right = mid - 1?

A rather common misunderstanding of binary search is that people often think this technique could only be used in simple
scenario like "Given a sorted array, find a specific value in it". As a matter of fact, it can be applied to much more
complicated situations.

3. Most Generalized Binary Search Template -:
   Suppose we have a search space --> It could be an array or range etc.
   ==> Minimize k; s.t. condition(k) is True

def condition(value) -> bool:
    pass


def binary_search(array: list[int]) -> int:
    left = min(search_space)  # could be [0, n], [1, n] etc. Depends on problem
    right = max(search_space)  # could be [0, n], [1, n] etc. Depends on problem

    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right-left)//2
        if condition(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left

What's really nice of this template is that, for most of the binary search problems, we only need to modify three parts
after copy-pasting this template, and never need to worry about corner cases and bugs in code any more:

a.  Correctly initialize the boundary variables left and right to specify search space. Only one rule: set up the
    boundary to include all possible elements;
b.  Decide return value. Is it return left or return left - 1? Remember this: after exiting the while loop, left is the
    minimal k satisfying the condition function;
c.  Design the condition function. This is the most difficult and most beautiful part. Needs lots of practice.


Problem : Sqrt(x) [Easy]
          Implement int sqrt(int x). Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative
          integer. Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of
          the result is returned.

Example:
    Input: 4
    Output: 2

"""


class Solution:
    def my_sqrt(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Search Space --> [1, 2, 3, ..., n]
        left = 0
        right = n + 1  # To deal with special cases like n = 0, n = 1

        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if mid * mid > n:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left - 1  # `left` is the minimum k value, `k - 1` is the answer
