/******************* Online brokerage system : Low level design *******************/
/** Definition: **/
An online stock brokerage system facilitates its users to buy and sell stocks. It allows users to track and execute transactions, and to see performance of different stocks in their portfolios.

It also alerts them (sends emails and push notifications) to changes in the stocks.
 
/** System Requirements  **/
    
1. Any user should be able to buy/sell stocks
2. A user can have multiple watchlists containing multiple stocks.
3. Deposit and withdrawal of money should be possible.
4. Send notifications when trades are executed.
    
    
/** Flows to discuss. **/
1. Place buy order.
2. Place sell order.
3. Receive market data.
    

/** What is expected from the design **/
1. Data modelling should cover every component/requirement of our system with appropriate relationships between models. Besides requirements, consider the "Flows to discuss" as well so as to not miss any important entity used in them.
2. Use of design patterns and standard code practices in design of classes/interfaces.
