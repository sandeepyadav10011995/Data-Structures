"""
Problem : Given a positive integer N, count all possible distinct binary strings of length N such that there are no
          consecutive 1â€™s.
Eg -:

Input:  N = 2
Output: 3
// The 3 strings are 00, 01, 10

Input: N = 3
Output: 5
// The 5 strings are 000, 001, 010, 100, 101

We'll use recursion first and if the last digit was '0' we have 2 options -> append '0' to it or append '1' to it
else if the last digit is '1' we can only append '0' to it since consequtive 1's are not allowed
